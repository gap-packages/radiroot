##  On the GAP Website there is an online version of all manuals in the
##  GAP distribution. To handle the documentation of a package it is
##  necessary to have:
##     - an archive containing the package documentation (in at least one 
##       of HTML or PDF-format, preferably both formats)
##     - the start file of the HTML documentation (if provided), *relative to
##       package root*
##     - the PDF-file (if provided) *relative to the package root*
##  For links to other package manuals or the GAP manuals one can assume 
##  relative paths as in a standard GAP installation. 
##  Also, provide the information about autoloadability of the documentation.
##  
##  Please, do not include unnecessary files (.log, .aux, .dvi, .ps, ...) in
##  the provided documentation archive.
##  
# in case of several help books give a list of such records here:

  # use same as in GAP            
  BookName  := "RadiRoot",
  ArchiveURLSubset := ["doc", "htm"],
  HTMLStart := "htm/chapters.htm",
  PDFFile   := "doc/manual.pdf",
  # the path to the .six file used by GAPs help system
  SixFile   := "doc/manual.six",
  # a longer title of the book, this together with the book name should
  # fit on a single text line (appears with the '?books' command in GAP)
  LongTitle := "Roots of a Polynomial as Radicals",
  # Should this help book be autoloaded when GAP starts up? This should
  # usually be 'true', otherwise say 'false'. 
  Autoload  := true

##  the package need other packages to be available?
